# Dynamic_Manning
The Repository for the Dynamic Manning efforts of the LTJG team of the DoD.

These are the prototypes of the ideas proporsed in our article ["Good Will Hunting: The Strategic Threat of Poor Talent Management"](https://warontherocks.com/2018/12/good-will-hunting-the-strategic-threat-of-poor-talent-management/). 

The proposal is to develop a detailing marketplace to improve upon the US Navy's process of placing servicemembers in billets around the world. The Department of Defense embodies a unique situation where it is a bureaucracy with a cpative job market; entrance is almost exclusively bottom up, many members are obligated due to contracts for many years, and job movement is compulsory if ordered to do so. The bureaucracy around this process has proven adept at accomplishing this piece of the national mission, this is our attempt to help make incrememtal improvements enabled by technology.

The efforts here were executed completely open source and do not express the product or views of the Department of Defense or the Department of the Navy.
