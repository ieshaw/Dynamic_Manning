\subsection{Generalism}

The generalism metric can be though of as a score for the amount by which a job seeker has transferable skills. A job seeker's generalist quotient to be the variance of their ranking by all job owners. If a seeker is a generalist, they will have a low variance compared to specialists whose skills will make them highly desirable to some job owners but not so much to others.

\begin{align}
\mu_i &= \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=1}^m P^O_{j,i} \\
\texttt{Generalism}_i &= \frac{1}{m^2} \big(P^O_{j,i} - \mu \big)^2
\end{align}
