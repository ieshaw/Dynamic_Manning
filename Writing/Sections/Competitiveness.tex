\subsection{Competitiveness}

The competitiveness of a billet can be considered a combination of the average ranking by other seekers, and the number of seekers who have placed a ranking. 

The competitiveness score for any given job could be defined as the average preference ranking of the job across all seekers.

Consider a set of preferences $\{P^{x}_{y,z} \in \mathbb{Z}^+: x \in \{O,S\}, y \in \{1, \dots, n\}, z \in \{1, \dots, m\}\}$. This indicates the positive integer preference ranking of either the job owner or seeker ($O$ or $S$) for the $n$ available jobs and $m$ seekers. 

Thus the competitiveness score $C$ for a given job $j$ could be defined as 

\[C_j = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{y=1}^m P^{x}_{y,j}\]
