\subsection{Specialization}

This metric was developed by the aforementioned former, junior Air Force officer.

A job seeker is a specialist to the extent that their skill set will serve a specific function well. Thus, a job seeker's specialization can be measured as the best preference ranking they are given by any job owner.

\[\texttt{Specialization}_i = \min \{P^O_{j,i} : \forall j \in \{1, \dots, m\} \}\]
