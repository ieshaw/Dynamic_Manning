\[\textit{Definition}\]
Similarity indicates how closely the preferences of two Sailors or two job ownersâ€™ preferences are aligned. 

\[\texttt{Similarity}(P^S_i, P^S_j) = 1 - \frac{1}{(m-1)^2}\sum_{k=1}^{m} \frac{2m - (P^S_{i,k} + P^S_{j,k})}{2m}(P^S_{i,k} - P^S_{j,k})^2\]

\[\textit{Impact}\] 
High similarity scores between pairs of sailors or pairs of job owners may be used to identify hidden groups; clusters of skills or jobs that are not clear to the naked eye. It may reveal unseen jobs or sailors, creating a more perfect information space. For instance, imagine two sailors, A and B, who have a high similarity score. If Sailor B did not know about a job, X, or did not rank that job for another reason, the similarity score may alert Sailor B that they are a good fit for that job if they did not receive any of their other preferences.
