\[\textit{Preference Allocation Windows}\]
Preference allocation indicates how many individuals received their top preference, how many individuals got a top one, top five, and top ten preference, and how many failed to be matched with any preference.

\[\textit{Average Preference Match}\]
Preference match is the sum of the ordinal preference of a sailor for their assigned command, and the ordinal preference of the command for their assigned sailor. For example if a sailor is assigned their most preferred command but the command ranked the sailor their, the preference match would have a value of 4. This metric provides a high level understanding of how the matching system performs in aggregates.

% \[\textit{Talent Distribution}\]
% Some job owners have multiple jobs. Ideally, such job owners would get an approximately equal set of preferences; one owner with five job slots would not get their first through fifth choices while another job owner with five job slots gets their 20th-25th preferences. 

% \[\textit{Preference Difference Gap}\]
% This metric helps to illuminate the separation between job owner and sailor preferences. This can be an indicator for senior leaders that neither sailors nor job owners had their preferences unduly weighted within the optimization system.
