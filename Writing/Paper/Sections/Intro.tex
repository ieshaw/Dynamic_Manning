Under the backdrop of the President of the United States issuing the Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence in February 2019, we created the algorithmic foundation for advancement of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) in military talent allocation.  Before the US Government can accomplish its both lethal and non-lethal AI/ML goals, however, it must embrace the essential building blocks underlying the buzzwords. One of those cornerstones is algorithmic linear programing, specifically the use of mixed integer programming (MIP).  In this piece, we reveal the most exquisite MIP algorithm completed thus far for the US Navy. 

We believe the world to be arcing toward the need for humans to grow as increasingly specialized workers, and in the vicious games of statecraft and war, allocating talent with hyper specificity will become a necessity for victory.  To that end, we theorized, coded, and prototyped an MIP algorithm that matches job seekers (sailors) and job owners (commanding officers).
