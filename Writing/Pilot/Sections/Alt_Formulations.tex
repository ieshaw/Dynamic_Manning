\subsection{Tweaking Objective Function}

Instead of a even weighting of job owner and seeker preferences in the objective function

\[f(x_{ij}) = x_{ij}(P^S_j + P^O_i)\]

Think of one where the Navy is seeking to enforce the ``Needs of the Navy'' upon the billeting process much more, weighting heavier the preferences of the job owners by a factor of ten

\[f(x_{ij}) = x_{ij}(P^S_j + 10P^O_i)\]

\subsection{Wagering}

Think instead of having the job seekers place preferences on all jobs, they have 100 points to distribute across all possible jobs. At the same time, job owners have 100 points for each opening

\begin{align*}
W^{S_i} &= \text{ Wagering vector of seeker $i$} \\
& \in [0,100] \cap \mathbb{R}^{m \times 1} \\
\sum_j W^{S_i}_{j} &\leq 100 \\
f(x_{ij})&= -x_{ij}(W^{S_i}_j + W^{O_j}_i)
\end{align*}
