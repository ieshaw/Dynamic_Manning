Instead of a even weighting of job owner and seeker preferences in the objective function

\[f(x_{ij}) = x_{ij}(P^S_j + P^O_i)\]

Think of one where the Navy is seeking to enforce the ``Needs of the Navy'' upon the billeting process much more, weighting heavier the preferences of the job owners by a factor of ten

\[f(x_{ij}) = x_{ij}(P^S_j + 10P^O_i)\]
