The objective function could be changed to maximize (minimize the negative) specialization aggregate of the Navy.

\begin{align}
L_{ij} &= \texttt{Specialization}^S_i \bullet \texttt{Specialization}^O_j \bullet (n - P_i^O) \bullet (m_a - P_j^S) \\
f(X) &= - \sum \sum L \bullet X
\end{align}

The function $f$ is the sum of the elements of the Hadamard (elementwise) product of the matrices $L$ and $X$.
