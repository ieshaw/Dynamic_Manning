The plot of Specialization vs. Competitiveness has a negative correlation. The negative correlation is expected and thus further validates the formulation.  A highly competitive market participant is desired by multiple firms, thus their skills generalize. A highly specialized market participant is desired strongly by few firms, making them un-competitive across the market when looked at in its entirety. Both competitive sailors and specialized sailors have a place in the Navy, and this metric validates their best placement.
