We ran our analysis on 5 data sources

\begin{enumerate}

\item Med Corps

\item EOD

\item CMS-ID

\item Air Force

\item NSA

\end{enumerate}

We collected the EOD and NSA data. We were provided the Med Corps, CMS-ID, and Air Force data. In these three preferences were not expressed completely; not every market participant expressed their ordinal preference for each opportunity. To create complete preferences we use the process developed by Shaw \cite{2019_Shaw}.
