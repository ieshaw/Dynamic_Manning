\subsection{Co-Location Algorithm: Adopting Gale-Shapely}

Suppose the goal of a system owner is to allow couples to co-locate more often, as was another intention of the National Residency Math Program. This can be achieved by allowing couples to submit preferences as pairs. A couple is considered co-located if they both receive a position in a submitted pair. In this scenario, a position is only given if the position improves the combined preference of the couple.
