Think instead of having the job seekers place preferences on all jobs, they have 100 points to distribute across all possible jobs. At the same time, job owners have 100 points for each opening

\textbf{TODO: Read Budish's work on this and incorporate}

\begin{align}
W^{S_i} &= \text{ Wagering vector of seeker $i$} \\
& \in [0,100] \cap \mathbb{R}^{m \times 1} \\
\sum_j W^{S_i}_{j} &\leq 100 \\
f(x_{ij})&= -x_{ij}(W^{S_i}_j + W^{O_j}_i)
\end{align}
