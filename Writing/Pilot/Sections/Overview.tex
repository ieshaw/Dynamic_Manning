The essential effort of this piece is to demonstrate the mathematical underpinnings of algorithmic matching for a defense application. That pilot application, however, was a very human process. The most difficult aspects were hardly the mathematics, however exquisite, but rather the communication needed to get stakeholders engaged as well as finding and declassifying the data. Nobel laureate Alvin Roth created a foundational matching algorithm, and he too experienced the same human and bureaucratic difficulties.

Roth suggests, ``overall, one lesson from the [matching project] is that mechanism design in a political environment requires that not only policy makers themselves be persuaded of the virtues of a new design, but that they be able to explain and defend the mechanism to the various constituencies they serve.'' \cite{2006_Atila} The explainability of our algorithm is relatively simple in that it matches preferences from two sides -- seekers and owners -- yet any sort of deviation from existing processes creates concern and risk, real or imagined.
