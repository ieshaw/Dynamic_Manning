Preference correlation is a metric built to understand the alignment of job owner preferences and job seeker preferences. This is the correlation ($R^2$) of a given job owner's preferences and the preferences of seekers for that job. 

Preference Correlation
Definition.

Impact. 
A lack of correlation indicates an information gap between job seekers and owners; seekers may not understand what skills a particular job requires or job owners may lack an understanding of what skills would be beneficial to have on their team.
