This is where our future work will go.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Explore implications of a ``Separation'' ($u$) preference

\item Explore strategic Importance of positions. This can either be an iteration where billets in priority tranche's are run iterative (tier 1 billets all matched, those sailors and billets are taken out of the pool, then tier 2 billets all matched, etc.). Or a weighting where in a single matching optimization the preferences of higher tiered billets are given a greater weighting

\item Does adding weight for specialization Iâ€™m objective function help the Navy better? Did job owners who wanted specialized sailors get them? Did sailors who wanted specialized jobs get them?

\item Tailored Compensation descisions. 

\item Incorporate timelines of expected roation date for availability windows.

\item Multiple firms and multiple workers, each sailor can opt into collaterals and other roles \cite{1982_Roth}

\end{enumerate}
