We apply a mixed integer programming solution to the placement of military service members to jobs. We further the body of work on matching algorithms by providing an alternate formulation to the integer program.  Additionally, we glean novel metrics from the expressed ordered preferences of both service members for jobs as well as job ownersâ€™ preferences for service members. These metrics are: specialization, competitiveness, similarity, and preference correlation. We formulated our prototype for the Department of Defense, specifically the Chief of Naval Personnel. Nevertheless, our work is agnostic and can be applied not only to any service branch, but to any matching market not requiring stability, defined by obliged market participants.  \footnote{The code to demonstrate the matching algorithms, optimization, and preference-based metrics can be found in Ian Shaw's \texttt{Dynamic\_Manning} Github Repository . \url{https://github.com/ieshaw/Dynamic_Manning}}
