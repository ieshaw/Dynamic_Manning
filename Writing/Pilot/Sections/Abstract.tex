In this project we apply Alvin Roth's work in mixed integer programming solution to the college admissions problem to the placement of U.S. Navy sailors to jobs. We further the body of work by providing alternate formulation to the integer program and metrics that are gleaned from the expressed ordered preferences of both the sailors for jobs and the job owners preferences over sailors. These metrics are: specialization, competitiveness, similarity, and preference correlation. Though our presentation is tailored to meet the stated fiscal year 2019 goals of the Chief of Naval Personnel, the work is agnostic and can be applied to any matching market not requiring stability as market participants can be compelled.  \footnote{The code to demonstrate the matching algorithms, optimization, and preference-based metrics can be found in Ian Shaw's Github Repository \texttt{Dynamic\_Manning}. \url{https://github.com/ieshaw/Dynamic_Manning}}
