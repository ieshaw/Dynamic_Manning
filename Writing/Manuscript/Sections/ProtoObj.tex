The objective function $f$ below is designed to improve over deferred acceptance in average preference sum, a metric described in Section \ref{pref_sum}. 

\[f(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m X_{ij}(P^S_{ij} + P^O_{ji})\]

Though a comparison to deferred acceptance is of academic interest, we also provide alternate formulations that may be of more pragmatic interest to military leaders. These include co-location (Section \ref{CoLocation}), quality spread (Section \ref{QualitySpread}), weighting the importance of certain command's preferences over others (Section \ref{Importance}), and retention (Section \ref{Retention}).
