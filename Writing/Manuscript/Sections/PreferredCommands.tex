Suppose service leadership were to favor some sort of command, such giving high-tempo operational commands twice the value preference over administrative commands This can easily be incorporated by a tweak to the objective function (\ref{obj_func}). 

\[f(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^m X_{ij}(P^S_{ij} + W_jP^O_{ji})\]

Here the vector $W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times 1}$ is a weighting vector. For example, if the service leadership were to value a command \#1 twice that of any other command then:

\[ W_i = \begin{cases} 2 & i = 1\\ 1 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\]
