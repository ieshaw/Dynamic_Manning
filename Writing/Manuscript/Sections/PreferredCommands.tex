Suppose service leadership were to favor some sort of command. This could look like giving operational commands twice the value preference over administrative commands, or favoring certain mission sets over others. This can easily be incorporated by a tweak to the objective function. 

\[f(X) = (P^S + WP^O)X \]

Here the vector $W \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times 1}$ is a weighting vector. For example, if the service leadership were to value a command \#1 which is highly operational twice that of any other command then

\[ W_i = \begin{cases} 2 & i = 1\\ 1 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\]
