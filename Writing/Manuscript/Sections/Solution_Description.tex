Our solution to the talent allocation problem is to optimize the matching of preferences from both sides: job owners (commanding officers) and job seekers (sailors).  Inspired by the Gale-Shapley algorithm, we pivoted to mixed integer programming, allowing for greater flexibility in creating constraints without largely rewriting the algorithm.
