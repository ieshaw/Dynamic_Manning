The co-location constraint takes the form

\[ \frac{1}{n_c} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \mathcal{D}(C_{ij}) \geq 0.95 \quad \texttt{at least 95\% of couples are co-located} \]

Distance Function $\mathcal{D}$ returns $1$ if the couple is considered co-located, 0 if not or if single. Here we choose 50 miles between job locations to be consider co-located because that is the threshold for receiving dislocation allowance (DLA) for a permanent change of station (PCS) according to the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR). The function $L(S_i)$ returns the location of the proposed station for Seeker $i$. 

\[\mathcal{D}(C_{ij}) = \begin{cases}
0 \quad & \text{ if } C_{ij}== 0 \\
 \mathbf{1}\big( || L(S_i) - L(S_j) || \leq 50 \big) \quad & \text{ otherwise }
 \end{cases}\]
