Given that our algorithm does not need to maintain stability, we are able to further optimize as compared to a deferred acceptance approach (the one used for hospital residents).  Our algorithm is shown to measurably improve placement at each incremental preference level. The improvements are even more notable when compared to the current non-algorithmic matching effort conducted by humans with imperfect information and an overwhelming amount of data. This human standard was measured by an officer who conducted a similar investigation for the Air Force \citep{2018_Lepird}.
