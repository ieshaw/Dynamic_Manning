The Department of Defense maintains a consistent matching problem in the placement of military members into jobs. The regularity of the process is due to the requirement that uniformed service members rotate positions every three years. Gale and Shapely provided a stable matching process 1962 that, if applied to this problem, would greatly improve the current, manual matching process. In this paper we go a step further noting that binary-integer programming can be applied in the matching process to sacrifice stability in favor of military leadership goals such as retention or quality spread. We formulated our prototype for the Chief of Naval Personnel. Nevertheless, our work is agnostic and can be applied not only to any service branch, but to any matching market not requiring stability. These markets are typically those where market members are legally bound to participate.
